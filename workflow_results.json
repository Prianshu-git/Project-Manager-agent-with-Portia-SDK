    "plan_output": "Okay, here's a detailed timeline with milestones for the \"Real-time Slack Notifications\" feature, based on the provided PRD and GitHub issue. I'm making some assumptions about the length of each task, but this should provide a solid framework.\n\n**Overall Timeline:** 8 Weeks (Estimated)\n\n**Phase 1: Planning (1 Week)**\n\n*   **Milestone 1: Requirements Gathering & Refinement (Days 1-3)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Clarify open issues from PRD (specific data sources, routing rules, dashboard URLs). Define specific API endpoints for data integration. Finalize UI/UX design for the configuration interface.\n    *   *Deliverables:* Documented answers to open issues, API specifications, UI/UX design mockups.\n*   **Milestone 2: Technical Design & Architecture (Days 4-5)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Design the system architecture, including data flow, component interactions, and database schema. Choose appropriate technologies and libraries. Plan for error handling, logging, security, and scalability.\n    *   *Deliverables:* Technical design document outlining architecture, technology stack, and implementation details.\n\n**Phase 2: Development (4 Weeks)**\n\n*   **Milestone 3: Data Integration & Deviation Detection (Week 2)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Implement data integration with specified financial data sources. Develop the logic for comparing actual data against expected ranges and identifying deviations.\n    *   *Deliverables:* Functional data integration module, deviation detection logic with unit tests.\n*   **Milestone 4: Slack Notification Implementation (Week 3)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Implement the Slack notification triggering mechanism. Develop the notification content formatting and routing logic. Integrate with the Slack API.\n    *   *Deliverables:* Functional Slack notification module with unit tests. Notifications should include all required information (metric name, values, difference, link, timestamp).\n*   **Milestone 5: Configuration Interface Development (Week 4)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Develop the web-based configuration interface for managing financial metrics, ranges, thresholds, and notification rules. Implement secure login and access control.\n    *   *Deliverables:* Functional configuration interface with user authentication and authorization.\n\n**Phase 3: Testing (2 Weeks)**\n\n*   **Milestone 6: Unit & Integration Testing (Week 5)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Conduct thorough unit and integration testing of all modules (data integration, deviation detection, notification, configuration).\n    *   *Deliverables:* Unit test reports, integration test reports, bug reports.\n*   **Milestone 7: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Week 6)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Conduct UAT with finance team members, managers, and executives (including user U09BJR8DRBP). Gather feedback and address any issues.\n    *   *Deliverables:* UAT test results, bug reports, user feedback documentation.\n\n**Phase 4: Deployment (1 Week)**\n\n*   **Milestone 8: Staging Environment Deployment (Days 36-37)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Deploy the application to a staging environment. Perform final testing and verification.\n    *   *Deliverables:* Deployed application in staging environment, staging environment test report.\n*   **Milestone 9: Production Deployment & Monitoring (Days 38-40)**\n    *   *Tasks:* Deploy the application to the production environment. Monitor system performance, error logs, and notification delivery.\n    *   *Deliverables:* Deployed application in production environment, monitoring dashboards, error logs.\n\n**Post-Deployment:**\n\n*   Ongoing monitoring and maintenance.\n*   Address any bugs or issues that arise.\n*   Gather user feedback for future improvements.\n\nThis timeline provides a structured approach to developing and deploying the \"Real-time Slack Notifications\" feature. Remember to adjust the timelines based on your team's capacity and the complexity of the implementation. Good luck!",
