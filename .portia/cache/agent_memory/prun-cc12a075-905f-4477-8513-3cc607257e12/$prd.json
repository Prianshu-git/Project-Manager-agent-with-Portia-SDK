    "value": "## Product Requirements Document: Lyst AI - Enhanced Filtering & Bulk Editing\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the requirements for enhancing the filtering and bulk editing capabilities within Lyst AI.  The current functionality is inadequate for users managing large lists, leading to inefficiency and frustration. This PRD aims to address these pain points by providing a clear roadmap for development.\n\n**2. Goals**\n\n*   Improve user efficiency in managing large lists within Lyst AI.\n*   Increase user satisfaction with Lyst AI's list management capabilities.\n*   Reduce the time required to perform common list management tasks.\n*   Prevent user churn due to usability issues related to list management.\n\n**3. Target Audience**\n\n*   Users who regularly manage large lists (e.g., hundreds or thousands of items) within Lyst AI.\n*   Users who need to quickly and efficiently filter and modify items within their lists.\n\n**4. Problem Statement**\n\nUsers managing large lists in Lyst AI experience significant pain points due to the lack of robust filtering and bulk editing capabilities. The current process is slow, clunky, and unusable at scale, leading to user frustration and reduced tool utility.\n\n**5. Proposed Solution**\n\nImplement enhanced filtering and bulk editing features to enable users to efficiently manage large lists within Lyst AI. This includes:\n\n*   **Advanced Filtering:**  Provide granular control over list item visibility based on various attributes.\n*   **Bulk Editing:**  Enable users to perform actions on multiple items simultaneously.\n*   **Performance Optimization:**  Improve the underlying data structures and algorithms to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.\n\n**6. Features**\n\n**6.1 Advanced Filtering**\n\n*   **Filtering by Attributes:** Allow users to filter list items based on attributes such as:\n    *   Price (range, specific value)\n    *   Category (specific category, multiple categories)\n    *   Keywords (containing, not containing)\n    *   Date Added (range, specific date)\n    *   Source (specific source, multiple sources)\n    *   Tags (specific tag, multiple tags)\n*   **Advanced Operators:** Support advanced filtering operators such as:\n    *   \"AND\" and \"OR\" operators for combining multiple filter criteria.\n    *   \"NOT\" operator for excluding items matching specific criteria.\n*   **Saved Filters:** Allow users to save frequently used filter configurations for easy access.\n*   **Clear Filter Indication:** Clearly indicate when a filter is active and display the current filter criteria.\n\n**6.2 Bulk Editing**\n\n*   **Bulk Deletion:** Allow users to select multiple items and delete them simultaneously.\n*   **Bulk Tagging/Categorization:** Allow users to apply the same tag or category to multiple selected items.\n*   **Bulk Modification:** Allow users to modify attributes (e.g., price, description) for multiple selected items simultaneously.  Provide options for:\n    *   Setting a specific value.\n    *   Incrementing/Decrementing a value (e.g., price increase by X%).\n    *   Appending/Prepending text to a field (e.g., adding a prefix to a description).\n*   **Selection Methods:** Provide multiple methods for selecting items for bulk editing:\n    *   Checkbox selection.\n    *   \"Select All\" option.\n    *   \"Select All Matching Filter\" option.\n\n**6.3 Performance Optimization**\n\n*   **Data Structure Optimization:** Review and optimize the underlying data structures used to store and manage list items.\n*   **Algorithm Optimization:** Optimize the algorithms used for filtering and displaying list items.\n*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Implement asynchronous operations for long-running tasks (e.g., bulk editing) to prevent the UI from freezing.\n\n**7. User Interface (UI) Considerations**\n\n*   **Intuitive Filtering Interface:** Design a clear and intuitive interface for creating and managing filters.\n*   **Clear Selection Indicators:** Clearly indicate which items are selected for bulk editing.\n*   **Confirmation Dialogs:** Implement confirmation dialogs for potentially destructive actions (e.g., bulk deletion).\n*   **Progress Indicators:** Provide progress indicators for long-running bulk editing operations.\n\n**8. Release Criteria**\n\n*   All features listed in Section 6 are implemented and tested.\n*   The filtering and bulk editing features are performant and do not negatively impact the overall user experience.\n*   The UI is intuitive and easy to use.\n*   Comprehensive documentation is provided for the new features.\n\n**9. Future Considerations**\n\n*   **Advanced Search:** Implement a more powerful search functionality that allows users to search for items based on complex criteria.\n*   **Customizable Attributes:** Allow users to define custom attributes for their list items.\n*   **Integration with Other Lyst AI Features:** Integrate the filtering and bulk editing features with other Lyst AI features (e.g., reporting, automation).\n\n**10. Metrics for Success**\n\n*   **Task Completion Time:** Measure the time it takes users to complete common list management tasks (e.g., deleting 100 items) before and after the implementation of the new features.\n*   **User Satisfaction:** Track user satisfaction with the list management capabilities through surveys and feedback forms.\n*   **Feature Usage:** Monitor the usage of the new filtering and bulk editing features.\n*   **Support Tickets:** Track the number of support tickets related to list management issues.\n\nThis PRD serves as a starting point and will be refined based on ongoing user research and feedback.",
    "summary": "The LLM Tool generated a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Lyst AI, focusing on enhanced filtering and bulk editing capabilities. The PRD addresses user pain points related to managing large lists, proposing solutions like advanced filtering (by attributes, operators, saved filters), bulk editing (deletion, tagging, modification), and performance optimization. It includes UI considerations, release criteria, future enhancements, and metrics for success. The document aims to improve user efficiency and satisfaction."
