cause Excel to crash or freeze.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Tasks:**  Each User Story can be broken down into smaller tasks for developers.\n*   **Labels:** Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., \"bug\", \"enhancement\", \"documentation\").\n*   **Prioritization:**  Prioritize issues based on impact and effort.  The initial impact score of 0.37 should be revisited after the research phase.\n*   **Dependencies:**  Identify any dependencies between issues.\n*   **Issue Tracking:**  Use GitHub's issue tracking features to manage and track progress.\n\nThis structure provides a good starting point for managing the development of the \"Native Excel Integration\" feature.  Remember to adapt and refine this plan as you gather more information and learn from user feedback.",
    "summary": "The LLM created a GitHub issue plan for the \"Native Excel Integration\" feature, outlining Epics and User Stories based on the provided PRD and research plan. The plan includes epics for core data retrieval, data manipulation, UI/UX, security, and compatibility/performance. Each epic contains user stories with acceptance criteria. It also suggests using tasks, labels, prioritization, and issue tracking features in GitHub."
